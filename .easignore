# --- Standard Ignores (Good Practice) ---
.DS_Store
.git
.hg
.svn
.vscode # Example IDE config
# ... any other editor or system files you don't need in the build

# --- directories that should never be in the build ---
# node_modules is often handled by EAS build, but explicit ignore is fine
# node_modules/

# Output directories you might have locally
build/
dist/
temp/

# --- Specific Ignores for your Issue ---
# This ignores any 'Library' directory found within your project tree.
# This is the most common way system folders get included via links.
Library/

# Let's try ignoring the *full path* just in case, though it's unusual
# for this to be relative or linked in a way this works typically.
# Include it just to be absolutely sure it's not being picked up relative.
/Users/johnasencio/Library/Saved Application State/com.easeus.datarecoverywizard.savedState

# You might also try ignoring the parent directory just in case of how it's linked
/Users/johnasencio/Library/Saved Application State/
